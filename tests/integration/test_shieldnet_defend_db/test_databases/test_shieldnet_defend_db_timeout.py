brief: Shieldnet-Defend-db is the daemon in charge of the databases with all the ShieldnetDefend persistent information, exposing a socket
       to receive requests and provide information. The ShieldnetDefend core uses list-based databases to store information
       related to agent keys, and FIM/Rootcheck event data.
       Shieldnet-Defend-db confirms that is able to save, update and erase the necessary information into the corresponding
       databases, using the proper commands and response strings.

## Purpose
Everyone knows the importance of having detailed system information from our environment to take decisions based on specific use cases. Having detailed and valuable information about our environment helps us to react under unpredictable scenarios. The shieldnetdefend agents are able to collect interesting and valuable system information regarding processes, hardware, packages, OS, network and ports.

The System Inventory feature interacts with different modules to split responsabilities and optimize internal dependencias:
- Data Provider: Module in charge of gathering system information based on OSes. This involves information about current running processes, packages/programs installed, ports being used, network adapters and OS general information.
- DBSync: This module has one single main responsibility: Database management. It manages all database related operations like insertion, update, selection and deletion. This allows ShieldnetDefend to centralize and unify database management to make it more robust and to avoid possible data misleading.
- RSync: is in charge of database synchronization between ShieldnetDefend agents DBs and ShieldnetDefend  manager DBs (each agent DB). RSync implements a unified and generic communication algorithm used to maintain ShieldnetDefend agents and ShieldnetDefend manager datasets consistency.
- Syscollector: Module in charge of getting system information from Data Provider module and updating the local agent database (through dbsync module). Once this is done, the rsync module calculates the information to synchronize with the ShieldnetDefend manager.


## Sequence diagrams
The different sequence diagrams ilustrate the flow of the different modules interacting on the syscollector general use.the configuration.
- 001-sequence-wm-syscollector: It explains the shieldnetdefend module syscollector initialization, construction, use, destruction and stop from the shieldnetdefend modules daemon perspective.
- 002-sequence-syscollector: It explains the syscollector internal interactions with modules like dbsync, rsync and normalizer. This diagram shows how is the flow for data synchronization, checksum calculation, scan starting, etc.
- 003-sequence-manager-side: It explains the modules interaction (analysisd, wdb) when a syscollector message arrives from the manager perspective. This diagram shows how is the flow from the modules initialization to the database storage.
